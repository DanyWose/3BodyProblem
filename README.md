# 3BodyProblem

This is a 2D-representation of the three body problem (three particles orbiting in a closed system).

Each two text cases are for x and y component of each particle, try setting a value so you can visualize all three particles.
You can drag them with your mouse too.

Press the big white button to start the simulation, it may take a time if maximum value of time is set too high (you can edit it in the .py).

Requires numpy, scipy(specifically the module "integrate"), pygame and pygame_gui to work properly, so here are the links:
Numpy: https://numpy.org/install/
Scipy: https://scipy.org/install/
Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
Pygame_gui: https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/v_067/
