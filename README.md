# 3BodyProblem

This is a 2D-representation of the three body problem (three particles orbiting in a closed system).

You can drag the bodies to set the initial conditions of the system.

Press the big white button to start the simulation, it may take a time if maximum value of time is set too high (you can edit it in the .py).

I know the code is way improvable, I'm working on it and a lot of features to improve its quality of life. Just be patient. :)

Requires numpy, scipy (specifically the module "integrate"), pygame and pygame_gui to work properly, so here are the links:

Numpy: https://numpy.org/install/

Scipy: https://scipy.org/install/

Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Pygame_gui: https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/v_067/
